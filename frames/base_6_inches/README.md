## Assembly the frame
The drone construction is based on a carbon fiber Frame, which is fastened using screws, secure nuts, and aluminum standoffs. The design files for each carbon fiber part can be found in the [frame](frame) folder, provided in DXF format for precision manufacturing. Below is a detailed breakdown of the parts that constitute the frame, including the thickness of each carbon fiber component:
* Top Plate: 1.5mm thick
* Bottom Plate: 2mm thick
* Front Arm: 6mm thick
* Rear Arm: 6mm thick
* Arm Holder: 2mm thick
* Aluminum Standoffs: 25mm in length
* M3 Bolts and Nuts: 12mm in size

An illustrative guide detailing the assembly of the frame is provided in the image below.
